# Classifying humans and horses images using Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
Dataset Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset)
* Created a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model from scratch (no transfer learning used) to classify humans and horses images
* Achieved ~86% accuracy on train dataset and ~90% accuracy on validation dataset
* Any feedback or suggestion regarding my work would be greatly appreciated
